	* Version 2.00.

	* Added functional interface (date, d8, ymd).

	* Load POSIX module only when needed.

	* Crunch numbers in C if compiler found.  (Install with 'perl
	Makefile.PL noxs' to select the pure Perl implementation.)

	* Can calculate the day of the week.

	* Reduced dependence on time_t, most functions work for dates up
	to 9999.
